            <p>Now In my first year 2024, I don't know what I want to do in the future yet. So I want to focus on learning in these 4 years <br> while I'm thinking about what I should do and what kind of works that I will like and want to do in the future.</p>
            <p><br> However the first condition about my career that on my concern is money, <br> so I think that what I will work in the future is based on how much money that I can makes. <br> If it earns a lot of money then I will do it.</p>
            <p><br> Now I have a plan that I want to learn a japanese as my third language and may be I want to work in Japan.</p>
            <p><br> In my future I hope that I still have the same feeling as my first year and I can enjoy my life and have some fun with my friends</p>
            <p><br> and the last thing that I really want to do is I want to go to a SEVENTEEN concerts in aboard like Japan or USA.</p>
